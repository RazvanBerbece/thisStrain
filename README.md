# thisStrain
Python-side, creates a ML model which identifies cannabis strains using a dataset of images scraped from the internet. The model takes as input an Image with (supposedly) a cannabis leaf and outputs its strain. Client-side (Swift), analyses the input image and outputs the strain label in a nicely-finished UI.
